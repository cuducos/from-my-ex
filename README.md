# From my ex

ðŸ’• _Sending all the love from my ex to my new happy and promisucous social media life._ ðŸ’•

In other words, this app gets the new posts (except replies and reposts) from my ex-social media and post to the new ones.

## Roadmap

- [x] Read last posts from my ex-social media
- [x] Parse the post in a suitable format to re-post in the new social media<br>(skip replies, replace mentions and hashtags, etc.)
- [ ] Control which posts were already reposted and which ones have to be reposted<br>(maybe persist a single `last_reposted_at` timestamp with the original post timestamp)
- [ ] Re-post to Mastodon
- [ ] Re-post to Bluesky

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Python 3.9 or newer
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)

### Configuration

These environment variables are required:

| Name | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `FROM_MY_EX_USERNAME` | User handle used in the ex, the blue bird one | `cuducos` (not `@cuducos`) | 
| `FROM_MY_EX_NITTER_INSTANCE` | A [Nitter](https://nitter.net/) instance [with RSS enabled](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances) | `https://nitter.d420.de` |

## Usage

```console
$ poetry install
$ poetry run python -m from_my_ex
```

At this time, this will list new posts formatted as they would be reposted in new social medias.
The output skips images (but they are downloaded and they bytes cached in memory, ready to be reposted).

## Contributing
